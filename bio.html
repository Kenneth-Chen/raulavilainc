        <p>Raul Àvila has been the president of Raul Àvila Inc., since founding the
          company in February 2005.</p>
          <br>
        <p>Driven to become a success in New York City, Mr. Àvila left his hometown
          of Bogota, Colombia in 1984.  Captivated by such elaborate set designs
          when attending designer presentations at New York Fashion Week, he soon
          recognized that event production was his calling.</p>
          <br>
        <p>In 1990, Mr. Àvila began his career in events in NYC working as
          assistant to the legendary event planner, Robert Isabell.  He thrived
          during his tenure at Robert Isabell Inc., with a promotion to Creative
          Director in 1998.  After spending
          14 years working by Mr. Isabell’s side, Mr. Àvila was compelled to take
          creative reign and venture out on his own.</p>
          <br>
        <p> With the same tenacity and drive that originally brought him to this
          country, Mr. Àvila saw rapid success upon starting his business.  A solid 
          foundation of clients that had the utmost faith in him, among them Anna 
          Wintour, Aerin Lauder, Oscar DeLa Renta, Marc Jacobs, Costume Institute 
          Gala, CFDA, Cartier, Town &amp; Country, Cond&eacute; Nast were integral 
          in establishing him as a fixture in 
          the fashion industry.  Known for his impeccable taste and
          talent, he quickly garnered an impressive roster of clients that remain
          faithful to his work today.</p>
          <br>
        <p>Specializing in floral design and sophisticated décor, Mr.
          Àvila produces special events ranging from benefits and weddings to
          fashion shows and photo shoots.  Most notably he has been responsible
          for overseeing the décor design for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s
          Annual Costume Institute Gala since 2007.  Still bestowed this honor at
          present, Mr. Àvila has the unique opportunity to transform the MET into
          an exquisite venue for this important benefit each year.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As his business matures, Mr. Àvila has his sights set on expanding his
          international presence in the events industry as well as introducing his
          own product line.  In addition, Mr. Àvila is evolving his philanthropic
          efforts, becoming more involved with the causes he supports.</p>
